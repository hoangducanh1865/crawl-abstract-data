# Crawl Abstract Data Tool
- Note: "x_x" represents the version of the code.
- This tool is used to crawl research papers (PDF files) from https://vjol.info.vn/ and extract the abstract section from all these papers.
- The output is a JSONL file containing around 2000 lines of abstract data.
- To start crawling data, run the file “craw_abstract_data_x_x.ipynb” in the folder "./src/crawl abstract data". Then, execute “convert_abstract_vietnamese_papers_x_x.ipynb” in the folder "./src/convert abstract vietnamese papers" to extract the abstract section from all the papers. The extracted data will be saved in the folder "./data/output/AGGREGATE DATA".
