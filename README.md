# Crawl Abstract Data Tool
• Note: *_* represents the version of the code.
• This tool is used to crawl research papers (PDF files) from https://vjol.info.vn/ and extract the abstract section from all these papers.
• The output consists of approximately 2000 .txt files.
• To start crawling data, run the file “craw_abstract_data__.ipynb” in the folder "./src/crawl abstract data". Then, execute “convert_abstract_vietnamese_papers__.ipynb” in the folder "./src/convert abstract vietnamese papers" to extract the abstract section from all the papers. The extracted data will be saved in the folder "./data/output/AGGREGATE DATA".
